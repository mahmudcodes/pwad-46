আজকে আমি #গুগল সহ, ফেসবুক, মাইক্রোসফট, ইনটেল এ আসা কিছু ইন্টার্ভিউ প্রশ্ন সোর্স সহ দিয়ে দিলাম। এই প্রশ্ন গুলোর ৮০% ই গুগল এর। আর এই প্রশ্নগুলোই মেক্সিমাম ক্ষেত্রে ইন্টার্ভিউতে গুগল জিজ্ঞাস করে থাকে। ইভেন এইখানে যে লিস্ট আমি দিয়েছি এই লিস্ট এই ৩টা question অ্যাড আছে, যা গত বছর ইন্টার্ভিউতে গুগল আমাকে করেছিল। আমার এখন পর্যন্ত জানা নেই, গুগল এর ইন্টারর্ভিউ এর প্রশ্ন কেউ কখনো শেয়ার করেছে কি না, তবে আমি জানি এইগুলাতে নিষেধ আছে তবুও আমি সবার সাথে শেয়ার করলাম কারণ আমি স্বপ্ন দেখি অন্য একটা বাংলাদেশ গড়ার। আর হ্যাঁ আমার লিষ্ট এ যারা আছো, কে কতো % এই প্রব্লেম গুলো স্লভ করতে পারবা কমেন্ট এ জানিয়ো 😁❤ সবার জন্য শুভ কামনা।
